# Jeopardy Data Analysis
-The data folder contains a list of the first 20,000 jeopardy questions from a jeopardy database. Given this data, I wanted to find how clues in the jeopardy data to find strategies for winning
-The analysis was mostly done with cleaning methods, summary statistics, and chi square probability tests


## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

- `jeopardy.ipynb` - Main Jupyter Notebook with code and analysis.
- `data/` - jeopardy.csv = extracted from (https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/)
  
## Main Insights

- The main insight is that 70 percent of important words in each question were used in a previous question. Studying past questions can help prepare for future questions because terms and topics are recycled throughout jeopardy.

- Other notes:
- Answers are hardly ever found within the questions
- Question length does not really vary by value
- It is possible to find how many terms are similar/recycled per category
